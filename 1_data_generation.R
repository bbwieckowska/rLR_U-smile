#and generated random variables from various probability distributions. 
#The predicted variable is coronary artery disease (>50% lumen stenosis in any major artery). 
#The analysis included 331 cases from the training set, of which 174 were classified as healthy, i.e., without coronary artery disease (the non-event class labeled as 0), and 157 as diseased (the event class labeled as 1).
